# Bullrun babes

Bullrun Babes are 8888 uniquely generated collectables built upon the Ethereum ERC-721 standard that powers most digital art and collectables. Each card is an NFT \(Non-Fungible Token\) that can be officially owned by a single person on the Ethereum blockchain.

There are three main tiers of Bullrun Babes cards:

1. Gold cards
2. Diamond cards
3. Rainbow cards

In addition to these three tiers, there are also Legend cards. Legend cards are a unique type of Rainbow card that have only a single copy in the entire supply. The Legend cards are: “0x\_1b, Anon, Blue Kirby, Boxmining, Chamath, Crypto, Maren, Pepe, Punk, Satoshi, and Wall Street Bets.” There is only one of each. Note: The 0xb1 Legend card will include a physical 1:1 production.
