If you have an NFT that you want to use to mint an NFTX single-fund token, you can use the instructions below.

The guidelines below describe how to mint a PUNK-BASIC token, but this same process can be applied to any of the D1 Single-Fund tokens.

## Minting a PUNK-BASIC token

You will need to have a Wrapped Punk in order to mint a PUNK-BASIC token. If your CryptoPunk is not yet wrapped, you can use the [Wrapped Punks](https://wrappedpunks.com/) site to wrap your CryptoPunk.

With your Wrapped Punk (WPUNK), you can go to the [NFTX](https://nftx.org/#/)  website. 

Connect your wallet to use the NFTX minting function.

In the top right-hand corner, you will see the **Connect Account** button.

When you click this button, you will be prompted to connect using either a MetaMask or Frame wallet. Connect your wallet to proceed with the rest of the steps below.

Select the [...] button from the homepage.

You will see three options: Mint, Redeem, or Inspect.

You can mint a token right from the index token right on the homepage, or you can select **Inspect** to review the information for that specific fund in more detail.

When you are ready to Mint your PUNK-BASIC token, select **Mint**.

A pop-out window will appear on the right-hand side of the page and there will be a prompt to insert the Token ID for your Wrapped Punk.

You can find the Token ID by reviewing your Wrapped Punk on the [Wrapped Punks](https://wrappedpunks.com/) site where you originally wrapped your CryptoPunk or you can go on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) and check in your wallet for the Token ID that is listed under the ERC721 token txns list.

You will find the Token ID listed with the transaction where you wrapped your CryptoPunk.

In the Token ID field, enter the Token ID for your Wrapped Punk.

If you enter the wrong ID, you will get an error message. The Token ID needs to match the CryptoPunk you have in your wallet; otherwise, you won’t be able to mint a PUNK-BASIC token.

When you enter the Token ID in the field, you will be prompted to approve the transaction. If you are minting multiple PUNK-BASIC tokens, you can select the Approve All button at the bottom of the page. Doing this will approve all the tokens at once and save you on gas for the txn fee.

After the approval transaction is complete, you are ready to mint your token(s).

Click **Mint PUNK-BASIC token** to complete the final txn in the token creation process.

Once complete, you will see the **PUNK-BASIC minted successfully** message.The PUNK-BASIC token is now minted and in your wallet.

You have now successfully minted a single-fund index token and deposited your underlying asset.
